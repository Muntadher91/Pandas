This code uses data sets from the last 10 season of the Italian Football League, First division (Serie A).
Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) is used to prepare the data, clean it, and analyse it.

For Graphs I used Plotly library (https://plotly.com/python/) to visualize the extracted stats.

This code is being updated regulary as more stuff being learnt!.
